              " Before joining the bootcamp,  I've  never written a line of code. 
              I needed some structure from  professionals who can help me  learn
              programming step by step.  I was encouraged to enroll by  a former
              student of theirs who  can only the wonderful things  about the
              program. The entire curriculum and staff did not  disappoint. They
              were very hands- on and I never had to wait long  for assistance.
              The agile team project, in particular,  was  outstanding.It took my
              learning  to the next level in a way that no  tutorial could ever
              have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
              example of my  develpent experience. It certainly  helped me land a
              job as a full- stack developer after receiving  multiple offers.
